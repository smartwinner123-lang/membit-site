      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="muted">Effective date: 2026-01-01</p>

      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how Membit (“we”, “us”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use the
        Membit mobile app and related services (the “Service”).
      </p>

      <h2>1) Who controls your data</h2>
      <p>
        The data controller is the Membit developer/operator. If you have questions or requests, contact:
        <a href="mailto:support@membit.app">support@membit.app</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>2) Information we collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Account information:</strong> If you sign in with Apple or Google, we receive an identifier for your
          account and basic profile info you choose to share (e.g., name/email depending on provider settings).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>App data you create:</strong> Vocabulary lists, learning progress, streaks, settings, and other content
          you enter in the app.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Device & diagnostics:</strong> App version, device type/OS, crash logs, and performance data to keep the
          app reliable and fix bugs (when available).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Subscription / purchase status:</strong> Whether you have an active subscription or premium access.
          <em>We do not store full payment card details.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3) Payments and subscriptions</h2>
      <p>
        Purchases are processed by Apple App Store or Google Play. We use <strong>RevenueCat</strong> to help manage
        subscriptions (e.g., entitlement status and subscription lifecycle). RevenueCat may process purchase-related data
        (such as product identifiers, subscription status, and device/app identifiers) to provide subscription services.
      </p>

      <h2>4) How we use information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide and maintain the Service (accounts, sync, progress tracking).</li>
        <li>Personalize your experience (e.g., learning schedule and settings).</li>
        <li>Operate subscriptions and verify access to paid features.</li>
        <li>Improve reliability, troubleshoot, and fix bugs.</li>
        <li>Respond to support requests and communicate about the Service.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5) Where your data is stored</h2>
      <p>
        We use <strong>Supabase</strong> as our backend/database provider. Your account and app data may be stored and
        processed on Supabase infrastructure and related cloud providers.
      </p>

      <h2>6) How we share information</h2>
      <p>We share information only as needed to run the Service, for example with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Supabase</strong> (database/auth infrastructure).</li>
        <li><strong>RevenueCat</strong> (subscription management and entitlement status).</li>
        <li><strong>Apple / Google</strong> (authentication and in-app purchase processing).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We may also share information if required by law, to protect safety and rights, or in connection with a business
        transfer (e.g., acquisition).
      </p>

      <h2>7) Data retention</h2>
      <p>
        We keep your data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the Service. You can request
        deletion (see below). Some information may be retained if required by law or for legitimate business purposes
        (e.g., fraud prevention).
      </p>

      <h2>8) Your choices and rights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Access / correction:</strong> You can request a copy or correction of your data.</li>
        <li><strong>Delete your data:</strong> You can request account deletion and removal of associated app data.</li>
        <li><strong>Withdraw consent:</strong> Where applicable, you may withdraw consent for certain processing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To make a request, email <a href="mailto:support@membit.app">support@membit.app</a> from the email associated with
        your account.
      </p>

      <h2>9) Security</h2>
      <p>
        We use reasonable safeguards to protect information. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, so we
        cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </p>

      <h2>10) Children’s privacy</h2>
      <p>
        The Service is not intended for children under 13. If you believe a child has provided personal data, contact us
        and we will take appropriate steps.
      </p>

      <h2>11) International transfers</h2>
      <p>
        Your information may be processed in countries other than where you live (for example, where our service
        providers operate). Those countries may have different data protection laws.
      </p>

      <h2>12) Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will revise the effective date above and may provide
        additional notice in the app or on this page.
      </p>
