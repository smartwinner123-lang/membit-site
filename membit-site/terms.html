      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p class="muted">Effective date: 2026-01-01</p>

      <p>
        These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the Membit mobile app and related services (the “Service”).
        By using the Service, you agree to these Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>1) Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service. If you are under the age of majority in your region, you
        represent that you have permission from a parent/guardian.
      </p>

      <h2>2) Your account</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and access.</li>
        <li>You agree to provide accurate information and keep it updated.</li>
        <li>We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3) Subscriptions and payments</h2>
      <p>
        Paid features may be offered as subscriptions or one-time purchases. Purchases are processed by Apple App Store or
        Google Play, and the store’s terms apply. We use <strong>RevenueCat</strong> to help manage subscription status.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Billing:</strong> Charges and renewals are handled by the App Store / Play Store.</li>
        <li><strong>Cancellation:</strong> Manage or cancel in your Apple ID / Google Play subscription settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Refunds:</strong> Refund requests are handled by Apple/Google under their policies.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4) License and acceptable use</h2>
      <p>
        We grant you a limited, personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Service for your own
        non-commercial use, subject to these Terms.
      </p>
      <p>You agree not to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract source code (except where permitted by law).</li>
        <li>Use the Service to violate laws or infringe others’ rights.</li>
        <li>Interfere with or disrupt the Service (e.g., hacking, scraping, or abusing APIs).</li>
        <li>Upload malicious code or attempt unauthorized access.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5) User content</h2>
      <p>
        You may enter content into the Service (e.g., vocabulary lists, notes). You retain ownership of your content.
        You grant us permission to host, store, and process your content solely to operate and improve the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>6) Intellectual property</h2>
      <p>
        The Service (including software, design, branding, and content provided by us) is owned by us or our licensors and
        is protected by applicable laws. Except for the license above, no rights are granted.
      </p>

      <h2>7) Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>
        The Service is provided “as is” and “as available.” We do not guarantee the Service will be uninterrupted or
        error-free. Vocabulary learning outcomes depend on many factors and are not guaranteed.
      </p>

      <h2>8) Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, we will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or
        punitive damages, or any loss of profits or data, arising from your use of the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>9) Termination</h2>
      <p>
        You may stop using the Service at any time. We may suspend or terminate access if you violate these Terms or if we
        discontinue the Service. Subscription cancellations must be done via Apple/Google settings.
      </p>

      <h2>10) Changes to these Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these Terms from time to time. We will update the effective date and may provide additional notice
        in-app or on this page. Continued use means you accept the updated Terms.
      </p>
