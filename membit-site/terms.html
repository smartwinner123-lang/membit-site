    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="kicker">Effective date: <strong>2026-01-01</strong></p>

    <p>
      These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the Membit mobile app and related services (the “Service”).
      By using the Service, you agree to these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>1) The Service</h2>
    <p>
      Membit provides vocabulary learning features (including spaced repetition, quizzes, progress tracking, and related tools).
      Features may change over time.
    </p>

    <h2>2) Accounts</h2>

      <li>We may suspend accounts involved in abuse, fraud, or violations of these Terms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3) Subscriptions & payments (RevenueCat)</h2>
<p>
  Some features may require a paid subscription (“Premium”). Pricing and subscription options are shown in-app.
  Membit uses <strong>RevenueCat</strong> to help manage subscriptions and purchase entitlements.
  Payments are processed by the <strong>Apple App Store</strong> or <strong>Google Play</strong>.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Payment is charged</strong> to your store account at confirmation of purchase.</li>
  <li><strong>Auto-renewal</strong>: subscriptions renew automatically unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.</li>
  <li><strong>Manage/cancel</strong>: you can manage or cancel in your device account settings (Apple ID / Google account subscriptions).</li>
  <li><strong>Restore purchases</strong>: use the “Restore Purchases” option in the app (if provided) to re-enable Premium on a new device.</li>
  <li><strong>Refunds</strong>: refunds are handled by Apple/Google under their policies.</li>
</ul>


    <h2>4) Acceptable use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract source code from the Service (except where permitted by law).</li>
      <li>Misuse the Service (spam, exploit, interfere with normal operation, or access data you don’t own).</li>
      <li>Use the Service for unlawful purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5) Your content</h2>
    <p>
      You retain ownership of content you create in the app (such as custom vocabulary). You grant us a limited license
      to host, store, and process your content solely to provide and improve the Service.
    </p>

    <h2>6) Intellectual property</h2>
    <p>
      The Service, including design, code, and branding, is owned by Membit and protected by applicable laws.
      You may not copy or distribute it except as allowed by these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>7) Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>
      The Service is provided “as is” and “as available.” We do not guarantee that the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free.
      Learning outcomes depend on individual usage and effort.
    </p>

    <h2>8) Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the maximum extent permitted by law, Membit will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential,
      or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or data, arising from your use of the Service.
    </p>

    <h2>9) Termination</h2>
    <p>
      You may stop using the Service at any time. We may suspend or terminate access if you materially violate these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>10) Changes to these Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms from time to time. We will update the effective date and, when appropriate,
      provide notice in the app or on this page.
