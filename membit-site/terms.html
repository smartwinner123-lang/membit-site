        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="muted">Effective date: 2026-01-01</p>

        <p>
          These Terms govern your use of the Membit mobile app and related services (the “Service”).
          By using the Service, you agree to these Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>1) Eligibility</h2>
        <p>You must follow applicable laws and app store rules. If you are under the age required to consent where you live, use the Service only with a parent/guardian’s permission.</p>

        <h2>2) Accounts</h2>
        <p>
          You may sign in with Apple or Google. You’re responsible for activity under your account and for keeping access secure.
        </p>

        <h2>3) Subscriptions, billing, and payments</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Paid features may be offered as subscriptions or one-time purchases.</li>
          <li>Payments are processed by the Apple App Store or Google Play (subscription management may use RevenueCat).</li>
          <li>Your purchase may auto-renew unless canceled in your store subscription settings.</li>
          <li>Refunds are handled according to Apple/Google policies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4) Acceptable use</h2>
        <p>You agree not to misuse the Service. For example, you will not:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Attempt to hack, reverse engineer, or disrupt the Service</li>
          <li>Use the Service for unlawful activities</li>
          <li>Upload content that is harmful, abusive, or violates others’ rights</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5) Your content</h2>
        <p>
          You keep ownership of content you create in the app. You grant us a limited license to host and process that content
          to provide the Service (e.g., syncing progress).
        </p>

        <h2>6) Intellectual property</h2>
        <p>
          The Service, including design and code, is owned by Membit or its licensors and protected by law.
        </p>

        <h2>7) Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>
          The Service is provided “as is” and “as available”. We don’t guarantee the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free.
        </p>

        <h2>8) Limitation of liability</h2>
        <p>
          To the maximum extent allowed by law, Membit will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential,
          or punitive damages arising from your use of the Service.
        </p>

        <h2>9) Termination</h2>
        <p>
          You may stop using the Service at any time. We may suspend or terminate access if you violate these Terms or if required by law.
        </p>

        <h2>10) Changes</h2>
        <p>
          We may update these Terms. If changes are material, we’ll provide notice in the app or on our website.
        </p>
